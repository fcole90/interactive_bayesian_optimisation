  #  Keywords related to function values
  x:
    comment: "list of sampled points for plotting the true function."
    type: "list of float"

  y:
    comment: "list of f(x) for each sampled point of the true function"
    type: "list of float"

  mean:
    comment: "list of means for the AI belief for each sampled point."
    type: "list of float"

  std:
    comment: "list of f(x) for each sampled point of the true function **WARNING:** list of std + mean for the AI belief for each sampled point,
           followed by a list of std - mean for the AI belief for each sampled point.
           The list is hence long twice the number of sampled points."
    type: "list of float"

  new_point_x:
    comment: "index of the `x`-list for the new queried point. **WARNING:** Not the actual x point,
              if you want the actual query point you need to do `query_point = x[new_point_x]`."
    type: "int"

  x_data:
    comment: "list of queried points. **WARNING:** Not the indices of the points, but the actual points."
    type: "list of float"

  y_data:
    comment: "list of user feedback values, one for each query point."
    type: "list of float"

  y_data_actual:
    comment: "list of true function values,f(x), for each each query point."
    type: "list of float"

    type: "int"

  n_points:
    comment: "integer, number of points in the sample space. You can use it like `np.linspace(start=x_limits[0], stop=x_limits[1], num=n_points)`."
    type: "int"

  x_limits:
    comment: "list of two elements (integers) containing the first and last point of the `x`-list.

    type: "float"

  save_split:

              When disabled it creates a single save file containing a list of data dictionaries, one for each iteration."
    type: "bool"

  scaling value:
